# Generators

## Random Graphs

*LightGraphs.jl* implements some common random graph generators:

```@autodocs
Modules = [LightGraphs]
Pages   = [ "generators/randgraphs.jl"]
Private = false
```


## Static Graphs

*LightGraphs.jl* also implements a collection of classic graph generators:

```@autodocs
Modules = [LightGraphs]
Pages   = [ "generators/staticgraphs.jl"]
Private = false
```

## Datasets

Many notorious graphs are available in the `Datasets` submodule in the companion package
*LightGraphsExtras.jl*
```
